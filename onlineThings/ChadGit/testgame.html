                China
                "China's "One Belt One Road" program funds infrasturcture and other industrial programs across Chad. By choosing China infrastucture cost is significantly decreased"

                America
                "The United States is the largest provider of foreign aid to Chad, through its US Aid program. By choosing America you increase the chance of food shipments"

            France
            "Since decolonisation, France has followed the Fran√ßafrique doctrine, meaning that it has maintained a strong millitary and economic presence in West Africa. Chad even uses the Central African Franc, which is gaurenteed by the French Treasury, and pegged to the Euro. By choosing France, this influence is use to supress revolts, thus civil unrest is far less common."

			Australia
	   		"Education and mining are some Australia's biggest industries. As you chose the Australian Advisor, Australian educational and mining expertise can be put to good use. Thanks to this, education is cheaper, and infrastructure detiriorates more slowly."
