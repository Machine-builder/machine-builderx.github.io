				<a>Chad Faces numeroius threats to food security. Boko Haram and other insergent groups threaten to cut Chad's links with Nigeria, where much of its food comes from. Beurocratic incompetance and corruption have stiffled economic growth, and have delayed any progress toward rebuilding Chad after what seems like an eternity of Civil War. Meanwhile, a growing population has put pressure on aging infrastucture and, along with Global Warming has contributed to shinking Lake Chad by 90% since 1960.

				   After Recent elections, a new government has come to power, you have been chosen as an advisor on food security and will guide Chad through its current crisis. You must build infrastucture, educate your people, and fight insurgent groups, all while keeping a ballanced budget.
